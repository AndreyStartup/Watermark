# Watermark

## Challenge
> Welcome to The Watermark Challenge! 💦🔍📸 This hackathon is an exciting opportunity for AI enthusiasts, programmers, and designers to come together and develop innovative solutions to tackle the problem of watermark detection in images. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create an AI-powered tool that can accurately classify images into two categories: with watermark and without watermark.<br></br>
The presence of watermarks can impact the visual quality and usability of images, and identifying them is a crucial step towards ensuring a seamless experience for users. Throughout this 15-day event, ending on 21st May 2023, you'll have the chance to work with like-minded individuals, learn from mentors, and compete for awesome prizes! 🏆💻🌟<br></br>
What to expect:<br></br>
🎓 Workshops & Mentors: Attend informative workshops in Machinehack Mondays and receive guidance from experienced mentors to help you develop your project.
🚀 Project Development: Collaborate with your team to create an AI model that can effectively classify watermark and no watermark images.<br></br>
